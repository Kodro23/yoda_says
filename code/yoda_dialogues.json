That sharp, and singing inside.      The holomap room in the Jedi Temple was a large domed chamber given over to celestial navigation. Here hologrammic projectors created three-dimensional star maps for students to walk through. These could be set to almost any scale, so a student might examine, say, one solar system in great detail, with each planet and satellite displayed in increasing resolution, showing every mountain and sea. Or the entire galaxy might be compressed into the space of the room, so nebulae of a thousand blazing suns were only pinpricks in the deep reaches of black space.    Whie had always liked the Star Room. No place in the Temple was more magical. When he was upset, or frustrated, or just needed time to himself, he would come here to walk among the stars. This afternoon had been trying. He had walked Scout to the infirmary and stayed to hear Master Caudle say the thumb she had sprained was not a serious injury. Then he had returned to accept polite congratulations from Master Xan and his fellow students for his performance in the tournament. He had done these things gracefully and well, because that was the standard to which he held himself; but it hadn't been easy, and he had slipped away as soon as he felt he could gracefully do so.    For a while he inspected his lightsaber, making sure it hadn't been damaged in the sparring, and carefully taking out a blemish on the handle where a stray blow had left a char line. Then he had tried to force himself to do some studying, sifting through the news dispatches to try to form an accurate picture of the war since the Honoghr disaster. The older apprentices talked about it all the time, and some of their instructors were very direct about using Clone War scenarios for their training. Last week Master Tycho, who was teaching military strategy this term, had demanded a rigorous evaluation of what had gone wrong on Honoghr, along with a set of recommendations from every student about what could have been done to prevent the debacle.    Whie had done well on the assignment\u2014he always did well; that, too, was a standard to which he held himself\u2014but in his heart, he wasn't sure that implementing his suggestions would have saved the day. He had the uneasy feeling that the reality was both more complicated and more simple than even Master Tycho wanted to believe. More complicated, because the lesson of the catastrophe was that no plan, however beautiful, long survives the harsh chaos of war.    More simple because Whie was coming to believe that situations, like people, could give in to the dark side: and once the 'dark side had one in its grip, it never, ever let one go.    After an hour of inefficient studying he had given up and come here, to the Star Room. The last person to use the room had been studying the Battle of Brentaal\u2014with key terrain color-coded by which side currently controlled them, watery blue for the Republic, and gleaming machine silver for area the Trade Federation's battle droids had held at the decisive moment of the conflict.    Whie deleted Brentaal and set the chamber's projectors to show the whole galaxy, running at a million years per second. Through these deeps of history he paced, watching stars form and burn and go out, feeling the wheel and swing of the whole spinning galaxy around him. From this view, none of it mattered\u2014not his dream last night, not the war today, not the whole long watch of the Jedi Order. Indeed, the rise and fall of sentient life passed in an eyeblink, a barely perceptible ripple in the grand pavane: comets and constellations dancing in the dark; the Force the music and the dancing, too.    The door of the Star Room cracked open, and a voice disturbed the great impersonal whirl of time. ", "To Tatooine.

In the dark Vjun air it was all he could do not to leap after Dooku, to fall on him like a green thunderbolt and annihilate him utterly.    ... But already he could feel the missile, too, dropping in a red scream through the atmosphere, two hundred armored kilos of explosive aimed for Chateau Malreaux. With a snort, Yoda turned his eyes to the sky and picked out the glowing dot racing in from the horizon.    Below him, Dooku landed softly on the ground and melted into the rose gardens.    The missile was coming in with terrible speed and power: too much coming at Yoda too fast ever to wholly stop it, even if he had time and perfect peace. But he reached out to pull up the Force binding even Vjun's bitter green moss and twisted thorn-trees, and let it flow through him like a wind: the breath of a world, gathered and released in a push-feather game with all their lives on the line, not to oppose the missile's force with force, but to touch it gently on the side\u2014just enough to send it screaming by the broken window casement to plunge a kilometer offshore into the cold and waiting sea.    A long instant later, water fountained from the ocean in a blaze of light three hundred meters tall, and then fell back.    The ch\u00e2teau and all those inside it had been spared: but Dooku was gone.      Moments later, Yoda trotted down into what had once been the great entryway of Ch\u00e2teau Malreaux, now a shattered and smoking ruin.
